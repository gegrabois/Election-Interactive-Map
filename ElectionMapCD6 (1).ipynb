        "The goal was to create an interactive Folium map of CD6, displaying VTD and county boundaries, with hover tooltips and click popups providing detailed information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings from Code Execution:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Loading and Reprojection:** Geographic data for VTDs (`vtds_cd6.geojson`), county boundaries (`County_Boundaries.shp`), precinct boundaries (`Precincts24G.shp`), and city boundaries (`City.shp`) were successfully loaded and reprojected to EPSG:3083 for initial processing.\n",
        "2.  **Attribute Data Preparation and Merging:** Attribute data from `cleaned_torv_data.csv`, `DemographicsFinal.csv`, and `final2022-2024PrimaryVotes.csv` were loaded. The 'CNTYVTD' or equivalent columns were cleaned and standardized across all datasets. This attribute data was then successfully merged onto the VTD GeoDataFrame (`vtds_cd6_gdf_proj`) using 'CNTYVTD' as the key, creating the `master_vtd_gdf`.\n",
        "3.  **Tooltip and Popup Data Preparation:** Columns required for the hover tooltip (County, Precinct, Cities) were selected, formatted, and combined into a `tooltip_text` column. Detailed data for the click popup (Demographics, Primary Votes, VR/Turnout) was extracted, formatted into HTML tables, and stored in separate HTML columns (`demographics_html`, `primary_votes_html`, `vr_turnout_html`).\n",
        "4.  **Interactive Popup HTML Generation:** A Python function was created to combine the basic VTD information, a dropdown menu, and the generated HTML snippets into a single `full_popup_html` column for each VTD. This HTML includes JavaScript to control the visibility of the different data sections based on the dropdown selection within the popup.\n",
        "5.  **Folium Map Creation:** A Folium map was initialized and centered on the CD6 area by calculating the centroid of the district boundary.\n",
        "6.  **Layer Addition:** The county boundaries (reprojected to EPSG:4326), the CD6 boundary, and the VTD layer (`master_vtd_gdf`, reprojected to EPSG:4326) were added to the Folium map.\n",
        "7.  **Tooltip and Popup Integration:** The `tooltip_text` column was successfully integrated into the VTD layer as a hover tooltip. The `full_popup_html` column was successfully integrated as the content for the click popup, enabling the interactive dropdown functionality within the map.\n",
        "8.  **Layer Control:** A Layer Control was added to the map, allowing users to toggle the visibility of the different geographic layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Outcome:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The task was successfully completed. An interactive Folium map of CD6 has been created. The map displays the boundaries of VTDs and counties. Hovering over a VTD displays a tooltip with County, Precinct, and City information. Clicking on a VTD opens a popup with a dropdown menu, allowing the user to view detailed demographic data, primary vote counts for specific candidates (Ellzey, Buford, Payne, Wiley) over time, and voter registration and turnout data over time (excluding Spanish Surname data). The map includes a layer control for managing layer visibility.\n"

        "## Summary of Solving Process: Creating an Interactive CD6 Map\n",

        "The goal was to create an interactive Folium map of CD6, displaying VTD and county boundaries, with hover tooltips and click popups providing detailed information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Findings from Code Execution:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Loading and Reprojection:** Geographic data for VTDs (`vtds_cd6.geojson`), county boundaries (`County_Boundaries.shp`), precinct boundaries (`Precincts24G.shp`), and city boundaries (`City.shp`) were successfully loaded and reprojected to EPSG:3083 for initial processing.\n",
        "2. **Attribute Data Preparation and Merging:** Attribute data from `cleaned_torv_data.csv`, `DemographicsFinal.csv`, and `final2022-2024PrimaryVotes.csv` were loaded. The 'CNTYVTD' or equivalent columns were cleaned and standardized across all datasets. This attribute data was then successfully merged onto the VTD GeoDataFrame (`vtds_cd6_gdf_proj`) using 'CNTYVTD' as the key, creating the `master_vtd_gdf`.\n",
        "3. **Tooltip and Popup Data Preparation:** Columns required for the hover tooltip (County, Precinct, Cities) were selected, formatted, and combined into a `tooltip_text` column. Detailed data for the click popup (Demographics, Primary Votes, VR/Turnout) was extracted, formatted into HTML tables, and stored in separate HTML columns (`demographics_html`, `primary_votes_html`, `vr_turnout_html`).\n",
        "4. **Interactive Popup HTML Generation:** A Python function was created to combine the basic VTD information, a dropdown menu, and the generated HTML snippets into a single `full_popup_html` column for each VTD. This HTML includes JavaScript to control the visibility of the different data sections based on the dropdown selection within the popup.\n",
        "5. **Folium Map Creation:** A Folium map was initialized and centered on the CD6 area by calculating the centroid of the district boundary.\n",
        "6. **Layer Addition:** The county boundaries (reprojected to EPSG:4326), the CD6 boundary, and the VTD layer (`master_vtd_gdf`, reprojected to EPSG:4326) were added to the Folium map.\n",
        "7. **Tooltip and Popup Integration:** The `tooltip_text` column was successfully integrated into the VTD layer as a hover tooltip. The `full_popup_html` column was successfully integrated as the content for the click popup, enabling the interactive dropdown functionality within the map.\n",
        "8. **Layer Control:** A Layer Control was added to the map, allowing users to toggle the visibility of the different geographic layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Outcome:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The task was successfully completed. An interactive Folium map of CD6 has been created. The map displays the boundaries of VTDs and counties. Hovering over a VTD displays a tooltip with County, Precinct, and City information. Clicking on a VTD opens a popup with a dropdown menu, allowing the user to view detailed demographic data, primary vote counts for specific candidates (Ellzey, Buford, Payne, Wiley) over time, and voter registration and turnout data over time (excluding Spanish Surname data). The map includes a layer control for managing layer visibility."

        "The traceback indicates that the 2022 and 2024 primary vote data did not contain the expected key columns after selection. The debug output shows that the original `primary_votes_df` uses \"VTD Identifier\" for the key. The selection logic for `votes_2022_df` and `votes_2024_df` needs to be adjusted to explicitly select \"VTD Identifier\" and then rename it to \"CNTYVTD\" in both dataframes before attempting the merge. The calculation of demographic changes also failed due to missing columns, although the debug output from the previous cell shows the demographic columns were present in `master_vtd_gdf` after merging. I need to re-examine the column names being used for the demographic calculations and ensure they match the columns present in `master_vtd_gdf` after the merges. I will regenerate the data preparation and merging code block again, fixing the primary vote data processing and the demographic change calculations.\n",
